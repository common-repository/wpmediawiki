== Description ==

WP-MediaWiki adds a subset of MediaWiki markups to WordPress.
Currently, the following MediaWiki markups are supported.

* Bold
* Italic
* Heading
* Lists: Besides the list markups come from MediaWiki, I also added a continuation markup such that users can put preformatted text in a list item.
* Tables
* External links
* WikiLinks: the wikilink will link to Wikipedia by default, you can change the wiki site in the admin option page.
* Table of content
* Horizontal line
* Preformatted text
